Provides up-to-date transit information for Kitchener-Waterloo-Cambridge including all routes and stops operated by Grand River Transit.

Never miss your bus again because you don't have data to search for arrival times. All your transit information is completely accessible without Data or Wi-Fi.

Are you unaware of your surroundings but need to find a bus to take as soon as possible? The Nearby Stops feature shows you a map of your current location and some stops that are nearby. Select one of those stops and you'll be presented with all the buses going to that stop and their arrival times within the next four hours (Note: This feature does requires GPS, WiFi or Data)

And last but not least -- Is there a certain bus you take frequently or a stop you use everyday on your way to school or work? Save it to your favorites list for easy access to relevant, personalized transit information as soon as you open the app.
